## DSA Programs

### Description
Welcome to the DSA Programs in C++ repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in C++. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn DSA concepts or an experienced programmer seeking to refresh your knowledge, this repository serves as a valuable resource for all your needs.

### Features
- **Well-Structured Code**: Each program is written in a clear and concise manner, with proper comments and documentation to enhance readability and understanding.
- **Diverse Collection**: Includes a wide range of data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.).
- **Educational Resource**: Ideal for students preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, or academic exams.
- **Example Usage**: Each program includes example input and output to demonstrate its usage and functionality.

### Contents
1. **Data Structures**
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
   - Graphs
   - Hash Tables

2. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
   - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
   - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
   - Greedy Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, etc.)
   - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Kruskal's Algorithm, etc.)

### How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DSA_Programs_CPP.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DSA_Programs_CPP
   ```
3. **Compile and Run**:
   Use a C++ compiler to compile and run the programs. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```
